Description: A counter program with 3 buttons namely reset, increase, and decrease the Label will change depending on the button clicked

Problems Encountered : - It took me a while to notice the styles.css file link I wrote <script src="styles.css"></script> instead of link ref="stylesheet" src="styles.css"
                       - I mistyped onclick to onlick
                       - I didn't know that label is an inline element so I need to add a display:block for the label to be text-align:center
                       - at the stles.css I used . instead of # for ID

Solution: I have to becareful about my typing and need to study css more.
